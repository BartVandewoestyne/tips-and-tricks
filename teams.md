# Hiding, Muting, Deleting chats

* Mute: When you mute a chat, you'll still be included in the conversation, but you won't get notifications from it.
* Hide: The chat and chat history will be hidden until someone posts a new message to it, and you can always resume an old conversation that you've hidden as well: Just search the name and find the conversation again.  It will be unhidden for as long as you stay in the conversation.  If you leave the conversation, it will be hidden again.
* Delete chat: Once you've selected Delete, the chat will be permanently removed from your chat list and conversation history will be deleted. When this happens, you won't be able to search for messages that were part of the deleted chat thread.

And for group chats:
* Leave:
