Tips
----

* To be able to capture loopback traffic:
  -> Make sure you don't have WinPcap installed.
  -> Make sure your install Wireshark with NpCap, not in WinPcap compatibility
     mode.
  -> It can be that you have to select another 'Ethernet X' adapter instead of
     the 'Npcap Loopback Adapter' in order to see traffic on 127.0.0/8 hosts.

Useful capture filters:
-----------------------
* To see only TCP traffic

    tcp
    
* To see TCP or UDP packets that contain a certain string:

    tcp contains foobar
    udp contains foobar

* To see TCP or UDP packets that match a certain string:

    tcp matches "foo.*bar"
    udp matches "foo.*bar"
