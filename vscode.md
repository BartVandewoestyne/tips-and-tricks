## Cache data

Cache data is located under `~/.cache/vscode-cpptools/` and can take up quite some space (I've once had 63 GB of cache data in it...)

## Git Support

Visual Studio Code has Git support built in.  You will need to have Git version 2.0.0 (or newer) installed.

## Issues I have or had

* On Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS the 'Go Back' functionality is not working when I press "Ctrl+Shift+-".  
  *Solution: don't use the minus character from the numeric keypad, use the other one.*

* Ruby shared examples not working.  
  See <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75756169/how-to-navigate-to-ruby-rspec-shared-examples-in-vscode/>

* If you get "The "foo" repository has 82 submodules which won't be opened automatically.  You can still open each one individually by opening a file within." from Source: Git, then you can go to your settings for the Git extension and change the "Detect Submodules Limit" from 10 to something higher.  You can also disable "Detect Submodules" if you want.
